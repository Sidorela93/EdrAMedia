<p class="top15 bottom25 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="350ms" style="font-family:'Graphik';">Cookies are files that are downloaded to the user’s terminal (computer/smartphone, tablet) when accessing certain web pages, and stored in its memory. Thanks to cookies it is possible, among other things, to store and recover information about the browsing habits of users or their computer, see the pages that have been visited and the duration of connection, or analyse the functioning of a web page, whether there are technical problems, etc. Depending on the information they contain and on how the terminal used, they may be used to identify the User.</p>
<h3 class="font-xlight wow fadeInUp fst-italic" data-wow-delay="300ms">What types of cookies are there?</h3>
<p class="top15 bottom25 wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="350ms" style="font-family:'Graphik';">Based on how long they remain in a computer, cookies can be classified into “session cookies” and “persistent cookies”. Session cookies disappear from the User’s computer when the User leaves the website or closes the browser. They are normally stored in the cache memory of the computer.

The expiry date of this type of cookies is determined by the website that uses them.</p>
