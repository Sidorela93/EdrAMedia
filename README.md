1.sendToMailchimp function:

This function is responsible for validating form fields before sending the data via AJAX to send_subscription.ajax.php.

It checks if any of the required fields are empty and if at least one of the privacy checkboxes is checked. If validation passes, it sends the form data using AJAX and shows a success or error message based on the response.

2.sendContactEmail function:

Similar to the previous function, this one handles sending contact form data to send_contact.ajax.php.

It checks for required fields and whether the privacy checkbox is checked. It sends the data via AJAX and displays the response message.
